Your challenge
We would like you to use the Brewdog API to create a small web-application using React. The API documentation can be found here: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
We encourage you to use any ui-framework (Material-ui, bootstrap, chakra-ui, whatever) or library (redux, mobx, whatever) to accelerate development.

User requirements
● As a user I want the application to show me beers using three different views (tabs):
● beers that pair with pizza --- Checked!
● beers that pair with steak --- Checked!
● all available beers --- Checked!

● As a user I want to easily navigate around the app and:
● For each beer in a view see the name, a picture and the abv --- Checked!
● Transition between views/tabs --- Semi-check!

● As a user I want to select a beer and see the following information:
● picture
● name
● tagline
● abv
● Description (collapsed if too long)
● food_pairing (collapsed if too long)

● As a user I want to sort the beers in each view/tab between:
● abv_ascending --- Checked!
● abv_descending --- Checked!
● name_ascending --- Checked!
● name_descending --- Checked!
